# Celosia

A native port of **Shadow of the Colossus** (PS2, USA, SCUS-97472) to macOS
(Apple Silicon) and the **PS Vita**, built by statically recompiling the
game's MIPS code to C++ with [PS2Recomp](https://github.com/ran-j/PS2Recomp).

No emulator runs the game's CPU code. The EE code from the boot ELF and the
game's three XFF modules is translated into C++ ahead of time and compiled
natively. The game is drawn by a native renderer (Metal on the Mac, OpenGL
ES on the Vita) that reads its model data directly. The rest of the hardware
it talks to (DMA, IOP, SPU2) is reimplemented as host code.

**Where it stands: [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md)** (and the live
[status dashboard](https://claude.ai/artifact/1RnzZd7UBKjDKzogkGEFN9)).

| New Game, intro, riding Agro, gameplay | ✅ |
| Performance, Mac (M4 Pro) | 60 fps, drawn at 1536×1344 |
| PS Vita | ✅ builds and runs (18–25 fps in Vita3K's intro); fidelity and speed in progress |
| Decompilation | started: software doubles rewritten and proven ([docs/decomp.md](docs/decomp.md)) |

## Requirements

- macOS on Apple Silicon, Xcode Command Line Tools
- `brew install cmake ninja pkg-config ffmpeg python`
- A disc image of **Shadow of the Colossus (USA)** (`SCUS_974.72`), as an
  `.iso` or a `.zip` containing one
- About 10 GB of free disk space and an internet connection for the first build
  (CMake downloads raylib, imgui and sse2neon)

## Quick start

```sh
git clone git@github.com:HenryKun55/celosia.git
cd celosia
./celosia setup --iso "/path/to/Shadow of the Colossus (USA).iso"
./celosia run
```

`setup` takes a while the first time: it compiles the runtime and around 16k
recompiled functions. It briefly opens the game window a few times while it
captures each module (see below).

### Settings

- **F1** (Select twice on the Vita): the player menu. Video, sound,
  language, in Portuguese or English.
- **F10** (Mac): the native renderer's panel. Resolution (× 512×448), bloom
  strength, fog amount and every effect on/off, changed live. "Print to log"
  gives the setting as `SOTC_*` variables that set it at start. The table is
  in [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md#settings).
- **F12**: the developer debugger (CPU, threads, DMA, memory).

### Controls

A gamepad works out of the box. Keyboard:

| Keys | PS2 |
| --- | --- |
| W A S D | left stick |
| arrows | D-pad |
| H / J | ✕ / ○ |
| Y / U | □ / △ |
| I / O | L1 / L2 |
| K / L | R1 / R2 |
| Z / X | Start / Select |

## How it works

Shadow of the Colossus ships one small boot ELF and loads the rest of its code
at run time: `KERNEL.XFF`, `MANAGER.XFF` and `GAMECORE.XFF`. These are
relocatable modules that the game links in memory with its own dynamic linker.
A static recompiler needs all of that code up front, so `setup` bootstraps it
in stages:

1. **Boot ELF.** Function boundaries are recovered with `tools/funcmap_elf.py`.
   Symbol names come from `KERNEL.XFF`'s imports. The ELF is recompiled with
   `game/scus.toml`.
2. **Module capture.** The game runs until it jumps into code that is not
   recompiled yet, which is the next module's entry point. Guest RAM is saved
   at that moment (`PS2X_DUMP_RAM_ON_MISSING`). The loaded module (sections at
   their final addresses, symbols resolved) is cut out of the dump.
   `tools/modimage.py` locates the module header automatically.
3. **Link.** `tools/build_elf.py` merges the boot ELF and every captured module
   into one `SOTC.elf`, with a function map and the list of instructions the
   guest linker rewrites (`dynamic_imm.txt`). The recompiler decodes those
   instructions from memory at run time. `tools/gen_config.py` writes the
   recompiler config.
4. Steps 2 and 3 repeat for KERNEL → MANAGER → GAMECORE.
5. **VU1.** A scripted run records every VU1 microcode image the game uploads.
   Each image is compiled to C++ (`./celosia vu1`). New images seen while
   playing are saved automatically, and `./celosia vu1` picks them up.

Everything generated (recompiled code, captures, build files) goes to
`build/`. None of it is committed.

## PS Vita

```sh
export VITASDK=~/vitasdk
./celosia vita          # after ./celosia setup: build/vita/ps2xRuntime/ps2EntryRunner.vpk
```

The first run also builds vitaGL at a pinned revision with this port's
patches. Install the `.vpk` (VitaShell, or File › Install in Vita3K). Then
put the extracted disc in `ux0:data/celosia/disc/`. Saves go to
`ux0:data/celosia/memcards/` and logs to `ux0:data/celosia/log.txt` and
`err.txt`. The Vita has no environment: `ux0:data/celosia/env.txt` takes
`NAME=value` lines (for example `PS2X_PROFILE=ux0:data/celosia/prof.txt`).

## Decompilation

The recompiled code works but is not readable. Functions that matter are
being rewritten by hand in C++ and proven equal to the recompiled ones, byte
for byte, on the same machine state (`SOTC_DIFFTEST`). It is a functional
decomp, not a matching one. The workflow (guest profiler, Ghidra scripts,
difftest) is in [docs/decomp.md](docs/decomp.md).

Progress (2026-10-23, round 6): **4.3%** of the MIPS code (406 of 9,024 functions, the
SDK / libc pieces the runtime implements included; 2.15% of the game's own
code), but **40%** of the guest calls already land in native code: the
rewrites go after the hottest functions first. Every native function is
listed in [docs/decomp_status.json](docs/decomp_status.json)
(`tools/decomp_status.py` recounts it).

| `SOTC_NATIVE_GL=1` / `check` | the OpenGL renderer on the Mac / compared against Metal |
| `PS2X_GS_GPU=0` | emulated view rasterized on the CPU (exact GS fog: the reference for fidelity checks) |
| `PS2X_MTVU=0` | run VIF1/VU1/GIF on the game thread instead of their own thread |
| `PS2X_GIF_THREAD=0` | process GIF packets on the VU1 thread instead of their own |
| `PS2X_GS_PROFILE=1` | where GS raster time goes, and what flushes the draw queue |
| `PS2X_VU1_NOREC=1` / `PS2X_VU1_REC_VERIFY=1` | interpret VU1 / cross-check the recompiled VU1 against the interpreter |

| `PS2X_DUMP_RAM_AT_SECONDS=n` + `PS2X_DUMP_RAM_PATH` | save guest RAM |

`tools/` also has analysis helpers: `addr2sym.py`, `callers.py`, `xref.py`
(symbols and call graph), `vudis.py` (VU disassembler), `gsdecode.py`,
`dmawalk.py`, `xffinfo.py`. Also:
- `native_run.sh` and `native_sbs.py`: the emulated and native pictures of
  the same moment, side by side;
- `ghidra.sh`: Ghidra headless scripts;
- `guest_profile.py` and `vita_profile.py`: the guest and Vita3K profilers;
- `vita3k.sh`: a separate Vita3K tree for testing.

## Layout

```
celosia                 the CLI
game/                   SotC-specific: boot ELF config, stub bindings, runtime overrides
tools/                  pipeline (XFF/ELF handling, function maps) and debug tools
PS2Recomp/              recompiler + runtime (git subtree of ran-j/PS2Recomp, with our changes)
```

Changes to PS2Recomp are kept generic: SPU2, VU1 AOT, asynchronous GS, VU0
fixes. They are meant to go back upstream.
